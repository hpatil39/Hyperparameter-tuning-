# Hyperparameter-tuning-
Hyperparameter tuning for a sequence prediction model using Keras Tuner

"""
README

This script performs hyperparameter tuning for a sequence prediction model using Keras Tuner.

1. Dependencies:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - keras
   - kerastuner

2. Data:
   - Make sure the training and test data are in CSV format.
   - Expected columns: 'sequence', 'target', 'id'.

3. Setup:
   - Install the required dependencies using pip:
     ```
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras kerastuner
     ```

4. Usage:
   - Place the 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' files in the same directory as this script.
   - Ensure the data files have the required columns: 'sequence', 'target', 'id'.
   - Run the script.

5. Output:
   - The script will output predictions in a file named 'predictions.csv' in the same directory.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Hyperparameters such as LSTM units, dropout rates, and learning rate are tuned.
   - The script uses RandomSearch to find the best hyperparameters.
   - Hyperparameters are saved in 'keras_tuner_results' directory.

7. Note:
   - This script assumes the sequences are the main features and performs tokenization and padding.
   - The target column should contain the values to be predicted.
   - Adjust the hyperparameter search space and other settings as needed.
   - Ensure the environment has sufficient resources for hyperparameter tuning.
